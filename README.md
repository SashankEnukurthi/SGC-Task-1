OVERIVEW OF THE PROJECT


Project:Student Grade Calculator using Python(tkinter module)

Objective:
  The "Student Grade Calculator" project would be an academic one using Python and has the objective of making a tool that can effectively calculate and manage student grades efficiently. Some of the common key objectives of this kind of project include:
 
  1: Input Handling
  
  2: Grade Computation
  
  3: Data Management
  
  4: Flexibility
  
  5: Automation
  

KEY ACTIVITIES:

**Data Calculation: Develop functions or methods to compute grades based on the defined criteria (e.g., weighted averages).

**User Acceptance Testing: Validate the system with actual users to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.

**GUI Design: Sketch or wireframe the layPython: The core language used to write the application logic. Python’s simplicity and readability make it suitable for developing both the backend logic and the user interface.out of the user interface. Decide on the placement of widgets like labels, entry fields,   buttons, and text areas.

**Setup tkinter Environment: Initialize the main application window and configure basic properties such as title and size.

TECHNOLOGY USED:

**Python: The core language used to write the application logic. Python’s simplicity and readability make it suitable for developing both the backend logic and the user interface.

**tkinter: The standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for Python. It provides tools to create windows, dialogs, buttons, labels, and other interactive elements. tkinter is used to build the graphical interface of the grade calculator.

**Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Tools like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or even Jupyter Notebook for writing, debugging, and testing the Python code.
